CHAPTER THREE: SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

3.1 System Analysis

System analysis is the process of studying a system in detail to understand its components, data flow, functionality, and performance. It involves examining how information is gathered, processed, stored, and disseminated, with the goal of identifying problems and designing improvements.
For this project, the analysis focuses on how students, lecturers, and administrators currently interact with the university’s information systems, the limitations they face, and how an AI-driven chatbot solution can enhance accessibility, efficiency, and user experience.

The system analysis phase also defines the functional and non-functional requirements of the proposed system. It determines what the system should do (functions such as responding to student queries, providing navigation guidance, and giving course or administrative information) and how it should perform (reliability, accuracy, usability, and scalability).

3.2 Analysis of the Existing System

The current system for providing information and support to students relies heavily on manual and semi-digital processes. Students often visit administrative offices or rely on word-of-mouth to obtain basic information about registration, course schedules, departmental requirements, or navigation around campus.
Although some online resources exist (such as the university website or notice boards), they are often static, lack interactivity, and are not available 24/7. The lack of a centralized, intelligent communication interface means that many students experience delays and confusion when seeking answers to common questions.

Additionally, the existing system offers no intelligent navigation support within the university environment. New students or visitors may struggle to locate faculties, offices, or lecture halls, especially on large campuses. The absence of an automated response system also increases the administrative workload on staff.

3.3 Problems of the Existing System

The major problems identified in the existing system include the following:

1. Inefficiency and Time Delays: Students spend excessive time trying to obtain basic information from various departments or physical offices.


2. Limited Accessibility: Information is often only available during office hours or through staff, restricting access outside working periods.


3. Lack of Centralization: Data and updates are scattered across multiple sources (e.g., notice boards, websites, offices), making consistency difficult.


4. No Real-Time Interaction: Students cannot interact dynamically with the system to receive instant, personalized feedback.


5. Poor Campus Navigation: There is no automated system to assist new students or visitors in locating facilities on campus.


6. High Administrative Burden: Staff members handle repetitive inquiries that could be easily automated through AI-based systems.

3.4 Overview of the Proposed System

The proposed system is an AI-powered university information and assistance chatbot integrated with features such as campus navigation, course information retrieval, administrative support, and student guidance.
It is designed to operate as an intelligent conversational interface capable of understanding and responding to user queries in natural language. Students can interact with the chatbot through a web or mobile interface to access academic information, locate offices and lecture halls, and receive guidance on university procedures.

This system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to interpret user intent and provide context-specific responses. It also connects to relevant university databases to ensure information accuracy and real-time updates.
By incorporating a navigation module, the chatbot helps users find routes within the campus environment, reducing confusion and improving mobility.

The proposed system aims to enhance information accessibility, reduce administrative workload, and improve the overall student experience within the university ecosystem.
